            <p id="description">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of 
                the printing and typesetting industry.
                 Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
                 standard dummy text ever since the 
                 1500s, when an unknown printer took 
                 a galley of type and scrambled it to 
                 make a type specimen book. It has 
                 survived not only five centuries, but
                 also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                  remaining essentially unchanged. 
                  It was popularised in the 1960s with 
                  the release of Letraset sheets 
                  containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
                   recently with desktop publishing software 
                   like Aldus PageMaker including versions 
                   of Lorem Ipsum.
